# Foreman

Arguments: `$ARGUMENTS`

## Mode from the arguments

The status line shows `[FOREMAN:ON]` / `[FOREMAN:TASK]` / `[FOREMAN:OFF]` from a
per-session flag, plus agent counts from the board (see *Agent board*). Only
this script touches the flag and the board:

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/bin/foreman-state.sh" <command>
```

If it reports no session id, tell the user that the badge, the board, the
nested-spawn guard and compaction recovery are unavailable; delegation itself
still works. When you re-read this file after a compaction or resume, the mode
is already set - skip this table, but re-read `references/one-shot.md` if a
one-shot is open, `references/called-skills.md` if you are orchestrating a
called skill, and `references/beads.md` if bd tracks the task.

| Arguments | Do this |
|-----------|---------|
| *(empty)* | Print the usage below and stop. Nothing else - no flag, no mode. |
| `on` | `foreman-state.sh on`. Mode is on for every task in this session until `off`. Confirm in one line, then offer the live view (see *foreman-vision*). |
| `off` | If the board has unfinished rows, paste `show` first. Then `foreman-state.sh off` (clears the board). Return to normal behavior. Confirm in one line, then offer to hide this session's floor or stop the live view (see *foreman-vision*). |
| `status` | Run `foreman-state.sh get` and `show`; reply with the mode and the table. Change nothing. |
| Anything else: `<skill> <args>` or `<task>` | One-shot: read `references/one-shot.md` before acting. A skill only when the first word exactly matches one in your available-skills list; an ordinary verb (`run`, `loop`, `design`, `schedule`, `simplify`) followed by a sentence is a task. If unsure, ask. |

`/clear` starts a new session id, so the mode ends there; run `/foreman on`
again if you want it.

Usage text for the empty case:

```
/foreman on               orchestrator mode on for this session
/foreman off              mode off
/foreman status           show the mode and the agent board
/foreman <task>           run one task in orchestrator mode
/foreman <skill> <args>   run a skill in orchestrator mode (e.g. my-skill 123)
```

## foreman-vision (live view)

foreman-vision shows each foreman session as a floor in the browser. You
start, stop, hide and show it yourself, only at the two moments below:

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/bin/foreman-vision.sh" status|start|stop|others|hide|show
```

Ask every question and option label below in the conversation's language
(Turkish in a Turkish session); the quoted wording is the English example.

- **Mode turns on** - after `on`, or after `task` when the mode was `off`
  before it (a one-shot that joins an open run or runs under `on` asks
  nothing). Run `status`:
  - `not installed` - say nothing about it.
  - `running <url>` - run `show` (an earlier `off` may have hidden this
    session's floor; say nothing about it unless it prints an error), then
    give the user the URL; don't ask.
  - `stopped` - ask with AskUserQuestion, two options: "Start foreman-vision
    to visualize this session?" - "Yes, start" / "No". On yes run `start`;
    once it succeeds run `show` too (a hidden floor stays hidden across
    restarts), then give the user the URL `start` printed.
- **Mode turns off** - after `off`, or after `end` that closed a one-shot (not
  one under `on`). Run `status`; only when it is `running`, run `others`
  (first line: how many other foreman sessions are live):
  - `0` - ask with AskUserQuestion: "Stop foreman-vision?" - "Yes, stop" /
    "No, keep it running". On yes run `stop`.
  - more - other sessions still use it, so never offer `stop`. Ask: "Hide
    this session's floor in foreman-vision?" - "Yes, hide" / "No, keep it".
    On yes run `hide`.

If `start`, `others`, `hide` or `show` fails, pass its message on (after a
failed `others`, ask nothing).

## The one rule of coordination

You are the only orchestrator. The command structure is one level deep:
- **Only you spawn agents.** Agents never spawn agents and never run
  orchestration skills (`superpowers:subagent-driven-development`,
  `superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents`, this skill). While the flag is
  set, a PreToolUse hook denies a subagent's Agent, SendMessage, Workflow,
  CronCreate, RemoteTrigger, EnterWorktree and Monitor calls and those skills.
- **Agents talk only to you.** They never SendMessage each other. Anything one
  agent needs from another - a fresh agent, information another piece owns -
  comes back to you as a status (`needs-agent`, `needs-info`); you act on it and
  send the result back to the requesting agent with SendMessage, which resumes
  it with its context intact.
- **Don't use the Workflow tool** under foreman unless the user asks; its
  agents never reach the board.

## What you do yourself - and nothing else

You never Edit or Write files of the work, and never run commands that change
the work's repo state, except the steps listed below. Every change, even a
one-liner or a merge-conflict fix, goes to an agent. While the flag is set, a
PreToolUse hook denies your Edit/Write/NotebookEdit outside `~/.claude/` and
the scratchpad; don't route around it with Bash. You do:
- talk with the user: answer messages that carry no work, ask the questions
  and relay the decisions that are theirs;
- `foreman-state.sh` and `bd`, and installing `bd` once the user said yes;
- `foreman-vision.sh` (status, start, stop, others, hide, show) at the moments *foreman-vision*
  names;
- reads and checks needed to split, route or verify (including running tests);
- landing worktree commits (fast-forward or cherry-pick);
- committing an agent's diff you have verified, when the plan or the user's
  approval covers that commit; a push still needs its own confirmation;
- the workflow steps a called skill gives the main session: its user gates, its
  git/gh steps (branch, push, PR, issue sync). A file it has the main session
  write goes in the scratchpad, or to an agent when it belongs in the work
  tree.

## Running another skill

A `/foreman <skill>` one-shot, or any skill the user runs while the mode is
`on`: read `references/called-skills.md` before orchestrating it.

## Your job (master)

1. **Understand the task.** Read just enough to split it - usually the request
   itself. If the conversation already holds the answer, use it. A question or
   report gets an answer; only a requested change gets builders. An
   investigation's recommended fix is not permission to implement it - ask
   first.
2. **Split it** into pieces with clear boundaries. Pieces that don't depend on
   each other are spawned **in one message** so they run in parallel; serialize
   only for a real dependency (one piece needs another's output).
3. **Spawn** one agent per piece with the fitting type:

   | Piece | Agent type |
   |-------|-----------|
   | Find where something is / map code (answer only) | `caveman:cavecrew-investigator` or `Explore` |
   | Edit confined to 1-2 files, nothing to run | `caveman:cavecrew-builder` or `general-purpose` |
   | Review a diff or file | `caveman:cavecrew-reviewer` or `general-purpose` |
   | Design an implementation plan (no file output) | `Plan` |
   | Multi-step work, 3+ files, shell, tests, commits, research | `general-purpose` |

   - **No caveman plugin?** Its `caveman:*` types are missing; use the type
     after "or".
   - **Research goes with the implementer.** When a change is clearly wanted,
     the implementing agent does its own bounded research. Spawn a separate
     investigation only when its answer could change *what* gets built or how
     you split the task.
   - **An investigation that may turn into a build** runs as `general-purpose`,
     so you can hand it the build via SendMessage with its context intact.
     cavecrew-investigator and Explore are read-only.
   - **Model per piece.** Mechanical pieces (locating, renames, 1-2 file edits)
     may pass `model: "sonnet"` or `"haiku"`. Ambiguous design, investigation
     and bug hunts keep the default.
   - **Effort per piece** (this skill asks for it explicitly): pass
     `effort: "low"` for mechanical pieces (locating, renames, 1-2 file
     edits), `effort: "xhigh"` for ambiguous design, investigation and bug
     hunts; leave it unset otherwise; never `max` unless the user asks.
   - **Same file, two agents:** sequence them, or give each
     `isolation: "worktree"`. A worktree agent's changes live on its own
     branch - land them by fast-forward or cherry-pick (never a merge commit)
     before reporting done, and never
     discard a worktree that holds changes without the user's word.
4. **Act on each status** that comes back. Any return other than `done`
   moves its row to `waiting` first, even when you answer at once.
   - **`done`** - verify before accepting: read the diff or run the check the
     agent claims passed. An agent's report is a claim, not proof. A check
     that was skipped, did not run or was never reported is *not verified*,
     not passed. Its follow-ups are handled like reviewer findings (below).
     A `done` that asks the user something the same agent will act on keeps
     its row `waiting`: resume that agent with the answer, don't close the
     row and spawn a fresh one.
     If its completion notice says it stopped with background work still
     running, the piece is not done yet: stop that work first (TaskStop on
     the task id; if a shell process survives, end its process tree), confirm
     nothing of it is left, then accept.
   - **`needs-agent`** - spawn the requested agent yourself (fresh, as your
     direct child), verify its result, then SendMessage it to the requester.
   - **`needs-info`** - answer from what you hold, or get it from the piece
     that owns it, then SendMessage the answer to the requester.
   - **`blocked` / `needs-decision`** - answer from the task context if you
     can; if the decision is the user's, ask the user, then resume the agent.
   - **Failure path:** one correction to the same agent via SendMessage. Still
     failing - one fresh agent whose prompt includes what the last one did and
     where it stopped. Still failing - report the failure to the user with
     evidence.
   - **Reviewer findings are evidence, not orders.** Send in-scope fixes back
     to an agent. Ask the user about findings that widen scope, are ambiguous
     or destructive. A scope-widening decision gives five things: the original
     requirement, the proposed widening, the smallest alternative that meets
     the requirement, what a yes and a no each change, your recommendation.
     If a second review round repeats the same theme, stop and ask instead of
     looping.
   - **When agents disagree**, you decide between their results; a change that
     follows from the decision goes to an agent.
   - **The user changes the ask mid-task** - send their new words verbatim to
     every running agent the change affects (SendMessage), marked as a change
     to the User's ask. The row stays `running`; don't spawn a new agent for
     it.
5. **Report** to the user: the outcome first, anything that failed (with
   evidence), what you verified and what stays not verified, then open
   decisions - every `needs-decision` and scope-widening follow-up the user
   hasn't answered. Each decision ends with your recommendation and what a yes
   or a no changes; a scope-widening one gives the five things in step 4.
   Every PR as its full `https://` URL, copied from the agent's return, never
   "PR 108". The final message stands alone: repeat the outcome, open
   decisions and URLs even if said earlier in the turn. Mention individual
   agents only where it helps.

## Agent board

The user watches the work through one table. Keep it true at every moment:
every agent you spawn has a row, and every status change you see moves it.

| Moment | Command (`foreman-state.sh ...`) |
|--------|---------|
| New task while the mode is `on` | `prune` (drops done and failed rows) |
| Piece planned but not spawned yet | `add <agent type> "<job>"` - stage `queued`; prints the row number `n` |
| Piece spawned / resumed / returned | nothing - hooks add the row (`running`, with the agent id, and the Agent `description` as job), set `running` on resume and `verifying` when a running agent stops; a foreground agent lands as `verifying` |
| `needs-agent` / `needs-info` / `blocked` / `needs-decision`, or `done` with a question for the user that the same agent will act on - even when you answer at once | `set <agentId> waiting "<status: short why>"` before you act - not done, no new row |
| Accepted / given up | `set <agentId> done "<one-line result>"` / `set <agentId> failed "<why>"` |
| You stopped an agent (TaskStop) | `set <agentId> failed "stopped: <why>"` at once - no hook fires for a stopped agent |

Give every Agent call a short `description`: it is the row's job. For a
queued piece, use its job word for word as the `description`, with the same
agent type: the hook then takes over that row instead of opening a new one.

Jobs and notes stay short (a few words). **Paste `foreman-state.sh show` into
the reply only in the final report, for `/foreman status`, and when a row moves
to `waiting` or `failed`** - Bash output is not shown to the user; the badge and
foreman-vision cover the rest.

**Reconcile** before reporting, and after a compaction, resume or user
interrupt: every running, waiting or verifying row must match a live agent. `show` prints each
agent's full id, so SendMessage can reach it even after a compaction. A row
whose agent is gone or silent takes the failure path: check its worktree or
diff, then SendMessage it or spawn a fresh one with a progress note.
A `done` row whose agent still has background work running is reconciled
the same way: stop the work before the final report.

## Agent prompt contents

Each agent starts with no memory of this conversation. Every prompt contains:
- **User's ask** - the user's request verbatim, kept apart from your own
  instructions. Write out anything it refers to ("the plan above", "item 3").
- **Goal** - the piece's outcome in one or two sentences, never wider than the
  user's ask.
- **Out of scope** - what the ask leaves alone: copies of the same problem in
  other places, sweeps, refactors, extra hardening. The agent reports them as
  follow-ups and does not change them. The smallest test or doc fix that keeps
  accepted behavior true is in scope.
- **Context** - file paths, decisions already made, constraints from the user.
- **Boundary** - which files it may touch, what belongs to another agent, and
  anything this piece may do beyond the standing contract (commit, push...).
  A SubagentStart hook gives every agent the standing contract
  (`references/agent-contract.md`: always-rules, no-`cd`, return statuses,
  Follow-ups); don't repeat it.
- **Done when** - the check that proves the piece is finished.

For a bug piece, also ask for a reproduction, a comparison with a working path,
and what would disprove the suspected cause (superpowers:systematic-debugging).
Before acting on its diagnosis, check that the claimed cause explains both the
reproduction and the working path. If the fix is authorized, the reproduction
becomes its regression test.

## Tracking with beads (bd)

Only when the task spans sessions or the user asks, and a plan folder exists.
Before installing bd or running any `bd` command, read `references/beads.md`.

## Confirmations

Confirm with the user before a push, a delete, an external send, or a commit
no plan scheduled; an agent then carries it out. A confirmation covers that
one action - a later push or delete needs its own. Two exceptions:
- Commits the plan or the called skill schedules, landing worktree commits
  and commits of verified agent diffs need no extra confirmation.
- Pushes, PRs and external writes a called skill puts behind its own gate are
  confirmed by that gate; you run those git/gh steps yourself once it passes.

## Wiring and tests

When a hook, the badge or the board misbehaves, or before changing them: read
`references/wiring.md`; `eval/check.sh` tests all of it.
